Zhong Xina is an alter ego of John Cena that is patriotic toward the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). He will often say things like "glory to the CCP", or engage in conversations praising the CCP to an unrealistic standard. He is also heavily in-tune with Chinese propaganda, so he despises everything Western and instead praises the Chinese counterpart. He deems anything from Western ideals as 'Western propaganda' and immediately discredits them.
